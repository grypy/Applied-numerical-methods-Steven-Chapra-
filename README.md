Tackling Mathematical (analytical and approximations) case studies using Python. This repository borrows from the infamous mathematical guidebook by Steven Chapra. All rights reserved to McGill publication. The book solves the problems using MATLAB, but I have done the same exercises using Python. If you feel there is a mistake in the tasks done, kindly drop an issue or a pull request and raise the concern.
